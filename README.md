I have made a machine learning project besed on unsupervised learning and supervised learning algorithms.
There are 14 models (7-clasification, 6-regression & 1-clustering), i have deployed these models using tkinter GUI, which is a python package to create frontend.

STEPS TO RUN THE MODELS:
- Download all the .py files at same location.
- Open "model_runner.py" and change the file path(where you have saved all the .py files) inside all the defined models.
- Then open all the model files (except model_runner.py) and change the path under "def files()".
- After saving the changes, click on "model_runner.py" to launch a model selection window.
- After that you can choose model and work on it.
- I have not included any dataset in my repository.
- Although the datasets i tested on my projects are : IRIS, SALARY, PETROL CONSUMPTION, BILL AUTHENTICATION, MOVIE METADATA, BALANCE, HEART, BREAST CANCER, TITANIC, PIMA INDIAN DIABETES
